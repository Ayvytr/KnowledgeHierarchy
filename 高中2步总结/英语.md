## 被动语态——一般将来时的被动语态

shall/will be done

won't/shan't be done

will/shall +主语+ be done?



### 易错点：

1. 别忘be动词

   My advice will definitely **be** taken at last. 

2. 注意否定形式not的位置

   More trees will not be destroyed in our willage.

3. 主将从现在被动中要保留

   If I'm given more time, I am sure I'll do it better.

4. 含有双宾语的主动变被动，间接宾语变成主语，直接宾语不变

   >My mom will give me a birthday present.
   >
   >me是间接宾语，a birthday present是直接宾语
   >
   >→I will be given a birthday present by my mom.

5. 不要丢介词

   We will look after the baby well.

   →The baby will be looked after will.

6. 使役动词have, get, make，感官动词see, watch, notice, hear, feel, observe等价不定式做宾补时，主动结构中省略to，变被动时要把to加上

   I will hear Mr Deng sing in the classroom tomorrow.

   →Mr Deng will be heared to sing in the classroom tomorrow.



> The wet weather will continue tomorrow, when a cold front **will be expected** to arrive.

> In near future, more advances in the robot technology **will be made by scientists.
>
> make advances in... by sb



> used to do	过去常常做
>
> be/get used to doing	习惯于做……
>
> be used to do 	被用来做……
>
> 
>
> In my opinion, life in the twenty-first century is much easier than _.
>
> A. that used to be
>
> B. it is used to
>
> C. is was used to
>
> **D. it used to be.** that是介词，后边加名词或代词，只有it可以做形式宾语



> I love to buy a new dress at a _ at the Spring Festival.
>
> **A. discount**：固定搭配at a bargain
>
> B. bargain
>
> C. pay
>
> D. cost

> How much did he charge you **for** the service?
>
> Luckily, it's **for** nothing. 省略了charge

> It's said that the power plant is now _ large as what it was.
>
> **A. twice as** twice as large as 
>
> B. as twice
>
> C. twice much
>
> D. much twice
>
> 先倍数再加要比较的内容

> How amazing would that be!
>
> > 感叹句：
> >
> > How+形容词/副词+陈述语序！
> >
> > How interesting this film is!
> >
> > What a/an + 形容词+名词+陈述语序！
> >
> > What an interesting film (it is)!

## 被动语态——现在完成时的被动语态

### 一般过去时和现在完成时区别

一般过去：只陈述发生在过去的动作

现在完成时：强调过去的动作对现在的影响。



肯定：have/has been done

My work has been finished.



否定：havn't/hasn't been done.

My work hasn't been finished.



疑问：Have/Has 主语 been done?

Has your work been finished?



### 用法：

1. 描述过去动作对现在的影响

2. 强调动作开始于过去，一直持续到现在

   How long has the film been on?



### 易错点：

1. 不忘be动词
2. 含有双宾语的主动变被动，间接宾语变成主语，直接宾语不变
3. 不丢介词



> His sister left home in 1998, and _ since.
>
> A. had not been heard of
>
> **B. has not been heard of**
>
> C. had not heard of
>
> D. has not heard of
>
> 需要用被动，AB是被动。since省略了：since 1998
>
> 过去完成对现在的影响，用现在完成时。  

> In recent years, many football clubs _ as business to make a profit.
>
> A. have run
>
> **B. have been run**
>
> C. had been run
>
> D. will run
>
> In recent years：现在完成时的标志词
>
> 用过去完成时，要有动作发生在过去的过去，或者有标志词did

> Shakespeare's play Hamlet _ into at least ten different films over the past years.
>
> A. Had been made
>
> B. was made
>
> **C. has been made**
>
> D. would be made

> Food supplies in the flood-stricken area _. We must act immediately before there's left.
>
> A. have run out
>
> **B. are running out**
>
> C. have been run out
>
> D. are being run out
>
> run out 没有被动语态，本身有被动的意思，如被用光，被耗尽。排除CD，句意应该是即将被用光要马上采取行动，所以选B，进行时态表将来

> Every year a flood of farmers arrive in Shenzhen for the money-making jobs they _ before leaving their hometowns.
>
> A. promised
>
> B. were promised
>
> C. have promised
>
> **D. have been promised**
>
> 被承诺，对现在有影响，用现在完成时

## 被动语态——现在进行时的被动语态

肯定：am/is/are being done

My car is being repaired now.

否定：am/is/are not being done

My car is not being repaired now.

疑问：Am/Is/Are 主语 being done...?

Is your car being repaired now?



### 什么情况下使用被动语态

1. 说话瞬间正在进行的被动动作

   He is being told the news now, so you don't have to inform him.

2. 表示现阶段正在进行的被动动作，但动作不一定在此时此刻发生

   How long is your work being done?

3. 表示一种习惯的被动行为，尝尝有赞赏，羡慕，讨厌等感情色彩，常与always, constantly等词连用

   He feels very surprised that I am always playing badminton(羽毛球) on weekend.

4. 与某些情态动词连用，表示对正在发生的动作的推测

   Tom may be being scolded(责骂) by his teacher at his moment.

### 解题注意

1. 判断主被动关系
2. 选择正确时态

#### 易错点

1. 不忘be动词
2. 含有双宾语的主动变被动，间接宾语变主语，直接宾语不变
3. 不丢介词

> I have to go to work by taxi because my car _ at the garage(车库，修理厂).
>
> A. will be repaired
>
> B. is repaired.
>
> **C. is being repaired**
>
> D. has been repaired

> Why don't we choose that road to save time?
>
> The bridge to it _.
>
> A. has repaired
>
> B. is repaired
>
> **C. is being repaired**
>
> D. will be repaired

> Traditional folk(民族) **arts** of Tianjin like paper cutting _ at the culture show of the 2010 Shanghai World Expo.
>
> A. are exhibiting
>
> B. is exhibiting
>
> **C. are being exhibited**
>
> D. is being exhibited

> They are living with their parents for the moment because their own house _.
>
> **A. is being rebuilt**
>
> B. has been rebuilt
>
> C. is rebuilt
>
> D. has rebuilt

> It is reported that many a new house _ at present in the disaster area.
>
> A. are being built
>
> B. were being built
>
> C. was being built
>
> **D. is being built**
>
> > 主句时态是现在时
> >
> > many a = more that one + 名词单数，谓语动词也用单数

|      |                             |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| N    | never, not, hardly 等否定词 |
| A    | as, though                  |
| O    | only                        |
| S    | so, such                    |
| H    | here, there地点和时间副词   |
| I    | if                          |

### 否定副词或短语置于句首，句子部分倒装

否定副词：never, nor, hardly, little, seldom, scarcely, rarely

否定短语：

* at no time
* under/in no circumstances
* in no case
* by no means
* on no condition
* on no account
* no sooner...than
* hardly...when

### A：形式倒装（前置）：as/though引导让步状语从句

=Although he was tired, he still went on with his work.



### O：only+状语 置于句首，句子部分倒装

Only in this way can we learn English well.

=We can learn English well only in this way.



#### 注意：

1. only+主语，句子不到装

   Only you can help me.

   Only can you help me.**(×)**

2. only修饰从句时，从句不倒装，主句倒装

   Only when he returned did we find out the truth.

   Only when did he returned did we find out the truth.**(×)**



### S：so/such...that 置于句首加强语气

so+be/do/情态动词+主语，表示也……

He is a teacher. So is his mother.

You can plan tennis. So can I.



万能句式：It is the same with sb.



### H：地点副词和介词短语置于句首，句子完全倒装

here, there, up down, in, away, off, out, back

now, then

in the room, on the wall



#### 注意：

1. 主语是副词时不倒装

   Here you are.

2. 谓语动词必须是简单时态，如一般现在时，一般过去时

   The bus is coming here!

   =Here comes the bus.



## I:if虚拟条件句的省略形式

If I were you, I would not let her go.

→Were I you, I would not let her go.

## 拆解长难句

1. 找连词，标三角（并列，转折，因果，递进等逻辑关系）
2. 找从句，划括号（从连词开始，到第二个谓语动词之前。保证从句里最多只有一个谓语动词）
   * 下一谓语动词结束
   * 到句尾结束
   * 到句中逗号结束
   * 到另一从句或修饰成分出现结束
3. 找介词短语，非谓语，划横线（介词+名词/代词，不定式，动名词，分词）
4. 留主干，译中文

## 虚拟语气

### If

| If从句，主句（主将从现，退一步） | If从句                          | 主句                               |

| 对过去的虚拟                     | had done                        | would/should/could/might have done |
| 对将来的虚拟                     | did<br />should do<br />were do | would/should/could/might do        |

**主过将 从过，主过将完 从过完**

#### 难点：

1. 一半过去一半现在：分开讨论

2. 一半虚拟一半真实

   I might have given you more help, **but** I was too busy.

   

   > Bob would have helped us yesterday, byt he _.
   >
   > **A. was busy**

   >
   > A. must have studied
   >
   > B. might study
   >
   > C. would study
   >
   > **D. would have studied**
   >
   > 从句一般过去时， 主句过去将来完成时

3. If省略，句子倒装

4. 含蓄条件句：句中不出现if，用其他手段代替。with, without..., or..., otherwise..., ... or else

   What would you do with a million dollars?

   =What would do if you had a million dollars?



​		I would not have passed this exam, without help.

​		=But for your help, I would not have passed this exam.

​		

> We lost our way in that small village, otherwise we _ more places of interest yesterday.

> Without electronic computers, much of today's advanced technology _.
>
> A. will not have been achieved
>
> B. have not been achieved

> **C. would not have been achieved**
>
> D. had not been achieved
>
> without 含蓄条件句，主句要有情态动词
>
> If we hadn't have/own/used electronic...



### 情态动词表示对过去的虚拟

could/might have done	本来能做却没做

should/ought to have done	本该做而没做（抱怨和责备）

should not/ought not to have done	本不该做而做了

needn't have done	本不必做而做了



### should类：以下及物动词接了宾语从句，从句应该用should do

一坚持：insist

二命令：order, command

三要求：require, request, demand

四建议：advise, suggest, propose, recommend

> 记法：I drop caps



被动语态要用虚拟语气：It is insisted that sb should do sth.

名词形式也要用虚拟语气：It is aproposed that sb should do sth.  



> 翻译为……不用虚拟语气：
>
> insist 坚持说
>
> suggest 暗示，表名



> The doctor insisted that the boy _ seriously ill and that _ on at once.
>
> A. be; be operated
>
> **B. was; be operated**
>
> C. be; was operated

## 强调句

It is/was +被强调部分+that/who+句子剩余成分

一般疑问句：Is/Was it+被强调部分+that/who+剩余成分

特殊疑问句：疑问词+is/was+it that +剩余成分



### 区别是不是强调句

1. 根据It is/was 后面的成分在句子中充当的成分来判断
2. 根据时态



一般：（疑问句：还原成陈述句）It is/was，that（或者要填的空）删掉，看句子意思完整就是强调句。

>
> A. when; then
>
> B. not; until
>
> **C. not until; that**
>

>
> 改写句子：he met... not until he came backed... 成分完整，是强调句
