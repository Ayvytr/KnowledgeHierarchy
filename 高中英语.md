## 万能的助动词

### 构成时态、语态

do：现在，过去，虚拟

will：将来

have：完成

be：进行，被动

### 构成虚拟语气：原来时态+did

比如：had done

### 表达情感

> I wonder if I might use your bike
>
> You mustn't park here!
>
> The door won't open!



## 非谓语动词

定义：不能当谓语的动词



|        | 不定式：主动 | 不定式：被动      | 动名词/现在分词：主动 | 动名词/现在分词：被动 | 过去分词 |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| 一般式 | to do        | to be done        | doing                 | being done            | done     |
| 完成式 | to have done | to have been done | having done           | having been done      | done     |
| 进行式 | to be doing  | -                 | -                     | -                     | done     |



解题：看主被动关系，看时间先后



非谓语动词是从句的省略形式

> Li is a teacher, who teaches English.
>
> Li is a teacher teaching English.

> I have the key, which is used to open the door.
>
> I have the key used to open the door.



> After completing and signing it, please return the form to us in the envelope _.
>
> A. providing
>
> **B**. provided
>
> C. having provided
>
> D. provide
>
> > 添成从句：..., ...in the envelop, which was provided.



### 动名词和现在分词做定语的区别

动名词做定语：表示用途和性质

现在分词做定语：与所修饰名词有诸位关系，强调动作进行性



> a sleeping boy 动作
>
> a sleeping bag 用途



### to be done, being done, done

to being done：强调将要被进行的动作

> The meeting to be held tomorrow is important.

being done：强调正在进行

> The meeting being held now is important.

done：强调被动或已经完成

> The meeting held yesterday was important.



### 独立主格结构/with的复合结构

独立主格特征：

* 逻辑主语与句子主语不同
* 逻辑主语和它后面的分词、形容词，介词短语等成分存在主谓/动宾关系

技巧：如果非谓语动作不是主语干的，谁干的把谁加上

非谓语动词有：

* 动名词，现在分词ving
* 不定式
* 过去分词



可用”with/without+名词/代词+宾补“结构替换独立主格：

> Weather permitting, we are going to visit you tomorrow.
>
> With weather permitting, ...



> The party will be held in the garden, weather _.
>
> **A**. permitting
>
> B. to permit
>
> C. permitted
>
> D. permit
>
> > 如果是if weather _，填permits，主将从现



### 分词做状语，勿偷换主语



### 能加非谓语动词做宾补的动词

接带to的动词不定式做宾补的动词有：want, ask, wish, tell, teach, encourage, warn, advise, order, force, like, allow, beg, cause, expect, invite, forbid, require, persuade+sb to do 

接不带to的动词不定式做宾补的动词有：

* 感觉，心理：see, watch, observe, notice, find, look at, hear, listen to, feel, think
* 使，让：make, get, have, leave, keep

## 被动语态

### 被动语态——一般将来时的被动语态

shall/will be done

won't/shan't be done

will/shall +主语+ be done?

#### 易错点：

1. 别忘be动词

   My advice will definitely **be** taken at last. 

2. 注意否定形式not的位置

   More trees will not be destroyed in our willage.

3. 主将从现在被动中要保留

   If I'm given more time, I am sure I'll do it better.

4. 含有双宾语的主动变被动，间接宾语变成主语，直接宾语不变

   > My mom will give me a birthday present.
   >
   > me是间接宾语，a birthday present是直接宾语
   >
   > →I will be given a birthday present by my mom.

5. 不要丢介词

   We will look after the baby well.

   →The baby will be looked after will.

6. 使役动词have, get, make，感官动词see, watch, notice, hear, feel, observe等价不定式做宾补时，主动结构中省略to，变被动时要把to加上

   I will hear Mr Deng sing in the classroom tomorrow.

   →Mr Deng will be heared to sing in the classroom tomorrow.



> The wet weather will continue tomorrow, when a cold front **will be expected** to arrive.

> In near future, more advances in the robot technology **will be made by scientists.
>
> make advances in... by sb



> used to do	过去常常做
>
> be/get used to doing	习惯于做……
>
> be used to do 	被用来做……
>
> 
>
> In my opinion, life in the twenty-first century is much easier than _.
>
> A. that used to be
>
> B. it is used to
>
> C. is was used to
>
> **D. it used to be.** that是介词，后边加名词或代词，只有it可以做形式宾语



> I love to buy a new dress at a _ at the Spring Festival.
>
> **A. discount**：固定搭配at a bargain
>
> B. bargain
>
> C. pay
>
> D. cost

> How much did he charge you **for** the service?
>
> Luckily, it's **for** nothing. 省略了charge

> It's said that the power plant is now _ large as what it was.
>
> **A. twice as** twice as large as 
>
> B. as twice
>
> C. twice much
>
> D. much twice
>
> 先倍数再加要比较的内容



### 被动语态——现在完成时的被动语态

一般过去时和现在完成时区别：

* 一般过去：只陈述发生在过去的动作

* 现在完成时：强调过去的动作对现在的影响。



肯定：have/has been done

My work has been finished.



否定：havn't/hasn't been done.

My work hasn't been finished.



疑问：Have/Has 主语 been done?

Has your work been finished?



### 用法：

1. 描述过去动作对现在的影响

2. 强调动作开始于过去，一直持续到现在

   How long has the film been on?



### 易错点：

1. 不忘be动词
2. 含有双宾语的主动变被动，间接宾语变成主语，直接宾语不变
3. 不丢介词



> His sister left home in 1998, and _ since.
>
> A. had not been heard of
>
> **B. has not been heard of**
>
> C. had not heard of
>
> D. has not heard of
>
> 需要用被动，AB是被动。since省略了：since 1998
>
> 过去完成对现在的影响，用现在完成时。  

> In recent years, many football clubs _ as business to make a profit.
>
> A. have run
>
> **B. have been run**
>
> C. had been run
>
> D. will run
>
> In recent years：现在完成时的标志词
>
> 用过去完成时，要有动作发生在过去的过去，或者有标志词did

> Shakespeare's play Hamlet _ into at least ten different films over the past years.
>
> A. Had been made
>
> B. was made
>
> **C. has been made**
>
> D. would be made

> Food supplies in the flood-stricken area _. We must act immediately before there's left.
>
> A. have run out
>
> **B. are running out**
>
> C. have been run out
>
> D. are being run out
>
> run out 没有被动语态，本身有被动的意思，如被用光，被耗尽。排除CD，句意应该是即将被用光要马上采取行动，所以选B，进行时态表将来

> Every year a flood of farmers arrive in Shenzhen for the money-making jobs they _ before leaving their hometowns.
>
> A. promised
>
> B. were promised
>
> C. have promised
>
> **D. have been promised**
>
> 被承诺，对现在有影响，用现在完成时

## 被动语态——现在进行时的被动语态

肯定：am/is/are being done

My car is being repaired now.

否定：am/is/are not being done

My car is not being repaired now.

疑问：Am/Is/Are 主语 being done...?

Is your car being repaired now?



### 什么情况下使用被动语态

1. 说话瞬间正在进行的被动动作

   He is being told the news now, so you don't have to inform him.

2. 表示现阶段正在进行的被动动作，但动作不一定在此时此刻发生

   How long is your work being done?

3. 表示一种习惯的被动行为，尝尝有赞赏，羡慕，讨厌等感情色彩，常与always, constantly等词连用

   He feels very surprised that I am always playing badminton(羽毛球) on weekend.

4. 与某些情态动词连用，表示对正在发生的动作的推测

   Tom may be being scolded(责骂) by his teacher at his moment.

### 解题注意

1. 判断主被动关系
2. 选择正确时态

#### 易错点

1. 不忘be动词
2. 含有双宾语的主动变被动，间接宾语变主语，直接宾语不变
3. 不丢介词

> I have to go to work by taxi because my car _ at the garage(车库，修理厂).
>
> A. will be repaired
>
> B. is repaired.

> 非真实条件句中的运用
>
> * 错综时间条件句
> * if省略句
> * 含蓄条件句
>
> wish/as if/though/if only
>
> should类
>
> 情态动词+have done
>
> 固定句型

### 非真实条件句中的应用

| If从句，主句（主将从现，退一步） | If从句                            | 主句                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 对现在的虚拟                     | did/were（**必须were，不能was**） | would/should/could/might do        |
| 对过去的虚拟                     | had done                          | would/should/could/might have done |
| 对将来的虚拟                     | did<br />should do<br />were do   | would/should/could/might do        |

**主过将 从过，主过将完 从过完**

* 主句过去将来时would do，从句用一般过去式
* 主句过去将来完成时would have done, 从句用过去完成时

#### 错综时间条件句

> If you had follow my advice just now, you would be better now.
>
> > 主从句都有时间标志词，分开各管各的

#### if省略句

> If I were you, I would not let her go.
>
> =Were I you, I would not let her go.

#### 含蓄条件句

句中有with, without, but for, or, otherwise, or else等，虽然没有出现if，但表示if的含义

> Without your help, I wouldn't have passed the exam.
>
> =If you didn't help me, ...

### wish, as if/though, if only

退一步：

* do：did

* did：had done

* will do：would do

> I wish I were a bird.
>
> =If only I were a bird.



---





> If Mr Dewey _ present, he would have offered any possible assistance to the people there.
>
> A. were
>
> **B. had been**
>
> C. should
>
> D. was

> John went to the hospital alone.
>
> If he _ me about it, I would would have done with him.
>
> A. should tell
>
> B. tells 
>
> C. told
>
> **D. had told**

> I should not have laughed if I _ you were serious.
>

>
> B. would think

>
> A. will be
>

> _ I you, I would go with him to the party.
>
> A. Was
>
> B. Had been
>

>
> **D. Were**
>

> _ the morning train, he would not have been late for the meeting.
>
> A. Did he catch
>
> B. should be catch
>
> C. has he caught
>
> **D. Had he caught**

> The weather has been very hot and dry.
>

> If we _ a table earlier, we couldn't be standing here in a queue.
>
> A. have booked
>
> B. booked
>
> C. book
>

### 情态动词表示对过去的虚拟

could/might have done	本来能做却没做

should/ought to have done	本该做而没做（抱怨和责备）

should not/ought not to have done	本不该做而做了

needn't have done	本不必做而做了

### should类虚拟语气：以下及物动词接了宾语从句，从句应该用should do

一坚持：insist

二命令：order, command, recommend(建议)

三建议：advise, suggest, propose, 

四要求：require, request, demand, ask

**记法：I drop caps**



被动语态要用虚拟语气：It is insisted/suggested that sb should do sth.

名词形式也要用虚拟语气：It is aproposed that sb should do sth.  



翻译为……不用虚拟语气：

* insist 真实情况：主从一致；虚假：should do

* suggest 暗示，表名：主从一致； 建议：should do



> I suggest (that) you (should) get up early in the morning.



> The doctor insisted that the boy _ seriously ill and that _ on at once.
>
> A. be; be operated
>
> **B. was; be operated**
>
> C. be; was operated
>
> D. was; was operated



### 固定句型

Would you mind sb+谓语虚拟?：你是否介意……？

would rather that sb+谓语虚拟：宁愿……

It is high time that sb did/(should) do sth. 到某人做某事的时间

It is necessary/important/essential/strange/natural/advisable that sb (should) do sth.

It is a pity/duty/shame/regret that sb (should) do sth.

But for/Without + sth+主语+谓语虚拟：要不是……

If only+主语+谓语虚拟：要是……就好了

主句+as if/as though+主语+谓语虚拟：就好像



### 难点：

1. 一半过去一半现在：分开讨论

2. 一半虚拟一半真实

   I might have given you more help, **but** I was too busy.

   

   > Bob would have helped us yesterday, but he _.
   >
   > **A. was busy**
   >
   > B. is busy
   >
   > C. had been busy
   >
   > D. will be busy

   > We _ last night, but we went to the cinema instead.
   >
   > A. must have studied
   >
   > B. might study
   >
   > C. would study
   >
   > **D. would have studied**
   >
   > 从句一般过去时， 主句过去将来完成时

3. If省略，句子倒装

4. 含蓄条件句：句中不出现if，用其他手段代替。with, without..., or..., otherwise..., ... or else

   What would you do with a million dollars?

   =What would do if you had a million dollars?



​		I would not have passed this exam, without help.

​		=But for your help, I would not have passed this exam.

​		

> We lost our way in that small village, otherwise we _ more places of interest yesterday.
>
> A. visited
>
> B. had visited
>
> C. would visit
>
> **D. would have visited**
>
> If we hadn't lost our way...

> Without electronic computers, much of today's advanced technology _.
>
> A. will not have been achieved
>
> B. have not been achieved
>
> **C. would not have been achieved**
>
> D. had not been achieved
>
> without 含蓄条件句，主句要有情态动词
>
> If we hadn't have/own/used electronic...

### 解题技巧

1. 找固定句型
2. 主过将从过，主过将完从过完







## 倒装结构：闹事原则

| 除AH，都是部分倒装 |                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| N                  | never, not, hardly 等否定词 |
| **A**：形式倒装    | as                          |
| O                  | only                        |
| S                  | so, such                    |
| H：完全倒装        | here, there地点和时间副词   |
| I                  | if                          |

### N：否定副词或短语置于句首，句子部分倒装

否定副词：never, nor, hardly, little, seldom, scarcely, rarely

否定短语：

* at no time
* under/in no circumstances
* in no case
* by no means
* on no condition
* on no account
* no sooner...than
* hardly...when



> Never before have I heard of such a name.
>
> By no means shall I change the plan. 我绝不会改变这个计划

> On no account will I make it.



### A：形式倒装（前置）：只把强调的内容提到句首，主谓不倒装；as/though引导让步状语从句

> Although he likes her much, he doesn't want to be with her.
>
> -Much as he likes her, he doesn't want to be with her.

#### 表语前置

> Although he was tired, he still went on with his work.
>
> -Tired as he was, he still went on with his work.



#### 名词做表语

> Although he is a little boy, he an help his mom a lot.
>
> -Little boy as he is, he can help his mom a lot.



#### 谓语动词前置

> Although he might try hard, he didn't pass the exam.
>
> -Try hard as he might, he didn't pass the exam.



### O："only+状语"置于句首，句子部分倒装

Only in this way can we learn English well.

=We can learn English well only in this way.



#### 注意：

1. only+主语，句子不倒装

   Only you can help me.

   Only can you help me.**(×)**

2. only修饰从句时，从句不倒装，主句倒装

   Only when he returned did we find out the truth.

   Only when did he returned did we find out the truth.**(×)**



> The bus is coming here!
>
> -Here comes the bus!

only if + did +主+谓语

> Only if you put the sun there did the movements of the other planets in the sky make sense.
>
> 只有当你把太阳放在中心位置上，天空中其他行星的运动才能说得清楚。
>
> Only if you try hard, will you succeed. 



if only：但愿，要是……就好了，常引导含虚拟语气的条件句或感叹句

If only I were a bird. 



> _ you eat the correct foods _ be able to keep fit and stay healthy.
>
> **A. Only if; will you** 
>
> B. Only if; you will
>
> C. Unless; will you
>
> D. Unless; you will





### S：so/such...that 置于句首加强语气：so adj/adv，such n

So angry was he that he couldn't speak.



so+be/do/情态动词+主语，表示也……

He is a teacher. So is his mother.

You can plan tennis. So can I.



> Mike is a clever boy.
>
> So is his little brother. 他弟弟也这样。



> Mike is a clever boy.
>
> So he is. 确实如此



万能句式：It is the same with sb.



### H：地点副词或介词短语置于句首，句子完全倒装

here, there, up down, in, away, off, out, back

now, then

in the room, on the wall



#### 注意：

1. 主语是副词时不倒装

   Here you are.

2. 谓语动词必须是简单时态，如一般现在时，一般过去时

   The bus is coming here!

   =Here comes the bus.



I：if虚拟条件句的省略形式：

> If I were you, I would not let her go.
>
> →Were I you, I would not let her go.



> _ the morning train, he would not have been late for the meeting.
>
> A. Did he catch
>
> B. Shouhd he catch
>
> C. Has he caught
>
> **D**. Had he caught
>
> > 倒装+虚拟，对过去的虚拟用过去完成时





## 过去分词做宾语补足语

主+v+宾+补

When he arrived, he found all the work finished. 发现所有工作被完成了



可以接非谓语形式做宾补的动词：表示感觉，心理状态；表示使，让；表示命令，希望，要求



| 宾补形式   | 动作情况                       | 宾语与宾补的逻辑关系 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| (to) do    | 动作完成或结果                 | 主动                 |
| doing      | 正在进行或持续                 | 主动                 |
| being done | 正在进行或持续                 | 被动                 |
| done       | 动作完成、状态，或动作的全过程 | 被动                 |

> To learn English well, we should find opportunities to hear English _ as much as we can.
>
> A. speak
>
> B. speaking
>
> **C. spoken**
>
> D. to speak
>
> 多听别人说英语，应是被别人说

> Before driving into the city, you are required to get your car _.
>
> **A. washed**
>
> B. wash
>
> C. washing
>
> D. to wash

> Alexander tried to get his work _ in the medical circles.
>
> A. to recognize
>
> B. recognizing
>
> C. recognize
>
> **D. recognized**
>
> 尽力使自己的工作被医学界被认可

> Claire had her luggage _ an hour before her plane left.
>
> A. check
>
> B. checking
>
> C. to check
>
> **D. checked**



## 过去分词做状语

1. 过去分词做状语（时间，条件，原因，方式，伴随）
   1. 分清主被动关系
   2. 分清动作已经完成还是同时进行
2. 分词做状语时，保持与句子主语一致，不要偷换主语
3. 独立主格结构



**先考虑主被动，后考虑时间关系**

> Time, _ correctly, is money in the back.
>
> A. to use
>
> **B. used**
>
> C. using
>
> D. use

> _ into English, the sentense was found to have an entirely different word order.
>
> A. Translating
>
> **B. Translated**
>
> C. To translate
>
> D. Having translated

> _ not to miss the flight at 15:20, the manager set out for the airport in a hurry.
>
> A. Reminding
>
> **B. Reminded**
>
> C. To remind
>
> D. Having reminded

> _ to reach them on the phone, we sent an email instead.
>
> A. Fail
>
> B. Failed
>
> C. To fail	动词不定式，表示动作还未发生
>
> **D. Having failed** 
>
> fail to do sth/succeed in doing
>
> 主动，我们没做成 





## 定语从句

定语：把原来的形容词和介词短语所做的定语成分换成一个句子

先行词：名词

关系词：连接主句和从句



**定语从句引导词绝对不是what**



| 限制性和非限制性定从 | 限制性       | 非限制性     |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 与先行词的关系       | 修饰限制作用 | 补充说明作用 |
| 逗号                 | 无           | 有           |
| 关系代词that         | √            | -            |



限制性：修饰限制作用，**that只用于限制性定语从句，和逗号不共存**

* 关系代词：who whom which whose that as
* 关系副词：when where why
* 介词+关系代词：whom which

非限制性：补充说明作用

* 关系代词：who whom which whose as
* 关系副词：when where why



**解题思路：**

* 找到从句画括号：连接词起，第二个谓语动词前止

* 根据成分选连词

  > 一看指人还是物（人：who, whom, whose, that；物：that, which, whose）
  >
  > 二看介词在何处
  >
  > > 介词在从句句首：whom, which。比如in **which**
  >
  > 三看句中作何用
  >
  > 四看是否属特殊



> 介词+不定代词的用法注意：
>
> 1. whose+名词=the 名词+of which/of which+the 名词
>
>    > Have you seen the man whose eyes are blue?
>    >
>    > -Have you seen the man **the eyes of which** are blue?



> Look out! Don't get too close to the house _ roof is under repair.
>
> **A**. whose
>
> B. which
>
> C. of which
>
> D. that
>
> > 如果后边是the roof，用of which



> That evening, **which** I will tell you more about later, I ended up working very late. 
>
> 
>
> By 16:30, _ was almost closing time, nearly all the paintings had been sold.
>
> **A. which**
>
> B. when
>
> C. what
>
> D. that
>
> 有逗号，不能用that，定语从句引导词绝对是what，when是副词不能作为主语
>
> > 1. 找到从句画括号
> >
> > 2. 根据缺少的成分选连词
> >
> >    主语：who，人；which，物；that，人/物

### 介词+不定代词的用法

1. 介词+whom/which

   There are 50 students in our class room, most **of whom** are boys.

   Here is Shandong, **in which** I grow up.

2. 介词的选择要结合从句的谓语动词

   Here is Shandong, **from** which I come.

3. **whose=of which**: whose+名词=the 名词+of which/of which+the 名词

   The house **whose roof/the roof of which/of which the roof** was damaged has now been repaired. 

> The man pulled out a gold watch, **the hands of which** was made of small diamonds.

> She showed the visitors around the museum, the construction _ had taken moren that three years. 
>
> 她带游客参观了博物馆，那儿的建筑都是三年以上的。
>
> A. for which
>
> B. with which
>
> **C. of which**
>
> D. to which

> He is such a clever boy **as** everyone likes.
>
> He is such a clever boy **that** everyone likes him.
>
> > (the same) such...as... 引导定语从句，句中as要做成分
> >
> > (the same) such...that... 引导状语从句，句中that不做成分
> >
> > 去掉that/as看从句是否完整

>In our class there are 46 students, **of whom** half wear glasses.
>
>half of...

> John invited about 40 people to his wedding, most of _ are family members.
>
> A. them 不能引导定语从句，介词放在前面用which/whom
>
> B. that
>

## 状语从句

| 状语从句 | 常用引导词                                        | 特殊引导词                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **时间** | when, while, as, once, till, since, until, before | not...until, as soon as, the minute/moment, the second, every time, no sooner... than, hardly...when |
| 地点     | where                                             | anywhere, everywhere, wherever                               |
| **条件** | if, as long as, unless, if only, in case          | providing/supposing that(考虑到), on condition that(如果，在……条件下) |
| 原因     | because, since, as, now that                      | seeing that, considering that, **given that(考虑到)**        |
| 目的     | so that, in case, in order that                   | lest, for fear that, in the hope that, for the purpose that  |
| 结果     | so that, so...that/such...that                    | to the degree/extent that                                    |
| 方式     | as, as if/though, how                             | the way                                                      |
| **让步** | though/although, even if, while, since            | no matter+特殊疑问词 特殊疑问词-ever                         |

### 时间状语从句

易错点1：when, while, as

* when 从句的谓语动词通常是短暂的
* while 从句的谓语动词一定是延续的



易错点2：till, until, not...until

* 肯定句：延续性动词until/till
* 否定句：非延续性动词not...until



### 让步状语从句

易错点1：though/although可与yet, still, nevertheless同时初选，但不能与but同时出现

* though可置于句末，表示不过，但是

  > He said he would help me; he didn't, though.



易错点2：while/whereas(虽然，鉴于)引导，强调主句与从句对比

> When I like him, I still see his shortcoming.



> _ you start eating in a helthier way, weight control will become much easier.
>
> A. Unless
>
> B. Although
>
> C. Before
>
> **D**. Once



## 名词性从句

分为：

* 主语从句：左边是It做形式主语/什么都没有
* 宾语从句
* 表语从句：左边是系动词
* 同位语从句：左边是抽象名词



解题：

1. 找到从句画括号

2. 根据成分选连词

   > 主语：who（人） what（物）
   >
   > 宾语：who/whom（人）what（物）
   >
   > 定语：which
   >
   > 状语：where, when, why, how
   >
   > 不做成分，无意义：that
   >
   > 不做成分，有意义：whether/if





### 易错点

**whether or not不能换为if or not**



if和whether引导从句

* 主语从句：句首可用whether
* 宾语从句：做vt.宾语：均可，但有区别；做介词宾语whether
* 表语从句/同位语从句：whether





if和whether和that引导从句

* that：无意义，不充当句子成分，宾语从句中可省略
* if/whether：是否，不充当句子成分，不能省略

做题技巧：

* 从句中不缺成分，应用that/whether(if)
* 然后看从句中是否缺含义，缺是否：填whether/if；不缺含义：填that



that和what引导从句：what不能引导定语从句，但能引导名词性从句

* what充当主语，宾语等成分；what引导名词性从句：what=all that 
* that不做任何成分



it做形式主语和形式宾语：

* 形式主语

  * It is + n/adj/-ed that... （）

    表示建议，要求，命令，愿望，义务，责任时，从句谓语动词常用(should) do：

    > It strange that he (should) say no.

  * It is + vi that...

* 形式宾语：

  * 含有复合宾语，可用it做形式宾语，常用此句型的动词：think, find, feel, consider, make, judge等

    > We that it impossible that you can finish the job.

  * 介词后的宾语从句可以用it来代替

    > I have nothing to tell you except/that I love you.



wh-ever引导的从句：

* whatever, whichever, whoever, whomever可做主语和宾语，引导从句相当于先行词+关系代词

  > I'll just say whatever comes to my mind.
  >
  > -I'll just say anything that comes to my mind.



reason引导的名词性从句：

* reason做主语，表语从句一般用that引导

* 用it/this/that做主语时，从句可用because/why引导

  The reason why/is that...

  It/This/That is because...

  It/This/That is why...

  It/This/That is the reason why...

  This is why... is that



主语从句和强调句的区别：不是强调句就是主语从句。强调句：It is/was ... that...。区分：去掉It be...that...后仍然通顺完整为强调句，否则为主语从句



同位语从句和定语从句的区别：

| 区别       | 语义     | that                                             | when, where, why                       | how  |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| 定语从句   | 修饰限制 | 有时可省，除连接句子外，还可充当主语、并与等成分 | 意义与先行词基本相同                   | 不用 |
| 同位语从句 | 补充说明 | 只起连接作用，不充当成分，不可省略               | 意义与被同位的词无关，跟疑问词本身相同 | 可用 |



## 强调句

It is/was +被强调部分+that/who+句子剩余成分

一般疑问句：Is/Was it+被强调部分+that/who+剩余成分

特殊疑问句：疑问词+is/was+it that +剩余成分

do/does/did +v  强调谓语

> do work together in some areas 的确在一些方面共同合作



### 区别是不是强调句

1. 根据It is/was 后面的成分在句子中充当的成分来判断
2. 根据时态



一般：（疑问句：还原成陈述句）It is/was，that（或者要填的空）删掉，看句子意思完整就是强调句。



> It was from only a few supplies that she bad bought in the village _ the hostess cooked such a nice dinner.
>
> A. where
>
> **B. that**
>
> C. when
>
> D. which
>
> 只用了村子里买来的东西一点点，能做出很好的晚餐

> Was it on a lonely island _ he was saved one month after the boat went down.
>
> A. where
>
> **B. that**
>
> C. which
>
> D. what

> I've read another book this week.
>
> Well, maybe _ is not how much you read but what you raad that counts.
>
> A. this
>
> B. that
>
> C. there
>
> **D. it**
>
> counts 算数，有用
>
> 是强调句：去掉 _ is...that意思完整
>
> 不是你读了多少书就有用 

> It was _ he came backed from Africa _ he met the girl he would like to marry.
>
> A. when; then
>
> B. not; until
>
> **C. not until; that**
>
> D. only; when
>
> 改写句子：he met... not until he came backed... 成分完整，是强调句



## 省略句

I believe (that) you will succeed.



### 句子成分的省略

主语省略

> Looks as if it will rain.

省略谓语

> The river was deep and the ice (was) thin.

省略表语

> Are you ready?
>
> Yes, I am (ready).

省略宾语

> Let's do the dishes. I'll wish (dishes) and you'll dry (dishes).



### 状语从句省略

* 当状语从句的主语和主句主语一致，且从句中有be动词，可将从句主语和be动词一起省略

  > Don't speak until (you) are spoken to.
  >
  > She stood there as if (she was) waiting for someone.
  >
  > Though (it is) cold, he still wore a shirt.

* 从句主语时it，谓语动词含有be，可以一并省略

  > I'll come to see you if (it is) necessary.

* so或not代指上下文的内容

  > Get up early tomorrow. If not (you don't get up early).

* 不定式的省略（to代指不定式内容，跟在动词后，否定用not to）

  > Will you join in the game?
  >
  > I'd be glad to (go).



>We all know that, _, the situation will get worse.
>
>A. not if dealt carefully with.
>
>**B. if not carefully dealt with**
>
>C. if dealt not carefully with
>
>D. not if carefully dealt with
>
>dealt：deal过去分词

> In my opinion, life in the 21st century is much easier than _.
>
> A. that used to be
>
> B. it is used to
>
> C. it was used to
>
> **D. it used to be**

> Who should be responsible for the accident?
>

>

> What an interesting story it is!

How adj a/an +可数名词单数+主谓！

> How interesting a story it is!

How adj/adv +主谓！

> How interesting the story is!



### 感叹句的省略

How +主谓！

> How (much) we love our country!

省略主谓

> What a clever boy (he is)!

其他形式

> How can you  be so selfish!



## 祈使句

### 否定和强调形式

> Don't be late!
>
> Do be careful!

### 为加强语气，在祈使句前可加主语

命令：You keep quite!

厌烦：You ind your own business!

分配任务：You, girls, clear the desks; you, boys, sweep the floor.

### 祈使句并列形式

祈使句+and+陈述句=If..., +主句

祈使句+or+陈述句=If...not..., +主句

> Work hard and you will succeed.
>
> If you work hard, you will succeed.
>

He dislikes playing football, doesn't he?

### There be

就近原则

There is a cow and several sheep.

There are several sheep and a cow.



集体名词不一般，

army, class, team, family, couple最常见

强调个体用复数，强调整体用单数

时间距离与货币，谓语多半用单数

百分，分数做主语，名词决定谓单复



and连接两主语，单复有异灵活变

many a, more than one, 谓语动词应用单

a boy or two谓用单，one or two boys谓用复  



there be, here be, not only...but also, either...or

neither...nor就近原则挂嘴边

with, like, except, but, together, with, as well as, 

rather than连接两主语，谓语看前定单复（就远原则）



## 现在完成进行时

表示动作从过去开始，一直持续到现在，动作仍在进行之中，或刚刚终止。

现在完成时：已完成，对现在有影响

# 做题

## 七选五解题步骤

1. 浏览全文，理清文章结构和主旨，30s
2. 三个关
   * 关联词
     * 总分，分总关系
     * 并列，转折，递进等逻辑关系
     * 解释说明关系
   * 关键词
   * 无关词
3. 带入选项，核对答案



## 短文改错

**要点/易错点：**

* 单复数

  没有复数的单词：

  * advice
  * information
  * housework
  * equipment

* a/an，the

  元音发音用an

  第一次提到用a/an，再次提到用the

* ing/ed

  **被动ed，主动ing**

* 形容词/副词

  形容词修饰名词，副词修饰动词

  **副词可以做句子开头**，比如：Luckily等

* 短语：do/doing sth

* 时态

  根据上下文确定时态

  特殊用法，比如I -ed, -ing sth.句型

* it/what等指代

  find it easy... 

* 上下文理解



## 阅读理解

最容易出题的地方：

* 段首段尾：划横线
* because，but后面：划冒号和闪电（though/although从句=but）
* 比较级和最高级：划圈
* 重要人物说的重要话语：横线+圆圈
* 加汉语注释又死活读不懂的长难句

阅读理解潜规则：

* 顺序对应原则：题目顺序就是答案在文中的顺序
* 同义替换
* 关键词原则



方法：

1. **先读题目，后看文章**
2. 只关注有用信息，不要让无效信息浪费时间
3. 注意隐含义，勿纠结字面意思。可借助近义词/反义词
4. 切勿凭感觉做题



### 拆解长难句

1. 找连词，标三角（并列，转折，因果，递进等逻辑关系）
2. 找从句，划括号（从连词开始，到第二个谓语动词之前。保证从句里最多只有一个谓语动词）
   * 下一谓语动词结束
   * 到句尾结束
   * 到句中逗号结束
   * 到另一从句或修饰成分出现结束
3. 找介词短语，非谓语，划横线（介词+名词/代词，不定式，动名词，分词）
4. 留主干，译中文，调语句，拼回来



### 培养阅读习惯

* Mark：做标记。标记有效信息
* Miss：略读无效信息
  * 专有名词（人，地，物）后面的解释说明
  * 论证或说明的具体步骤
  * 照抄原文还抄错段落的选项略读→细节题不跨段落，除非有是极端
* Match：同义替换
  * 原文压根没提过的不选
  * 原文有但定位错误的不选
  * 细节题跨段落的不选
  * 主旨题扩大或缩小的不选
  * 逻辑混乱的不选：因果、时间、程度、包含



### 细节题

简单细节题和标志词：

* 事实细节：what, when, where, who, which, why, how
* 因果细节：for, as, why, because, since; due to, lead to, result from, owing to, cause...
* 目的细节：purpose, to, aim to, in order to, so as to...

复杂细节题：

* 作者/段落/具体细节观点
* 某个例子证明了什么观点



### 推断题

标志词：suggest, infer, imply, intend, conclude, means, indicate...

角度：

* 问出处，身份，对象
* 问目的
* 问隐含义
  * 复述原文的不选
  * 主观臆断的不选
  * 因果倒置的不选

解题方法：

1. 识别推断

2. 准确定位

3. 正向/逆向推理

   正向：看情感，标正负

   逆向：对比转折，弦外之音

4.  锁定答案



### 词义猜测

解题方法：

* 原文解释或例子
* 借助逻辑关系词
* 利用构词法

### 主旨题

选择文章标题/作者的目的或写作意图



解题方法：

* 通篇略读，把握大意
* 找主旨句：首（一般是首段最后一句/第二段第一句），末，中
  * 圈关键词
  * 忽略细节：for example, to begin with, first类似举例，列举不可能出现主旨句
* 选择标题或概括主旨，避免：以偏概全，主题扩大，断章取义，无中生有



### 语篇结构题

标志词：organized, structure, the way of, serves as(充当)

类型：

* 段落结构形式或作用
* 文章结构形式
* 具体细节的结构形式

解题方法：

* 判断文体

* 浏览全文，

  * 找每个段落的中心句
  * 抓主干，段首段尾
  * 关键词
  * 理先后逻辑

* 确定作用




## 完形填空

考察：

* 词汇：词义，辨析，搭配
* 上下文：
  * 瞻前顾后：通览全文，重视首尾句，预测主题
  * 左顾右盼：逻辑，上下文
  * 顾全大局：符合答案，全面检查
  * 义无反顾：除非逻辑和小词辨析错误，尽量不大面积修改
* 短语和搭配：动词，名词和代词是重点；形容词，副词，介词，连词相对较少。

**做题要点：**

* 100%拿下第一句：找主线，拆首句
* 不把时间花在“扫描”上，而是“锁定”答案上
* 随时能返回来做题：往往空后线索占大部分

**关键：不要瞎蒙，证据不足就是蒙**



复习建议：

* 找主线，拆首句
* 搜集阅读材料：励志/温情，先抑后扬的故事
* 突破高频词汇、短语和搭配，词义辨析，形容词副词，介词连词to/at/in/on/above等



选项的秘密：

* 动词：根据前后搭配
* 名词：找同类
* adj/adv：感情色彩：正/负/中性
* 介词连词：根据逻辑关系。to/at/in/on/above

      -Being a student, I should study hard and try my best to become a useful person for our country.

   3. 肯定不如否定好

      Everyone is affecting others more or less, and at the same time affected by others.

      -There is hardly a man or a woman who is not affecting or affected by others.

   4. 主动不如被动好
