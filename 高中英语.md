|           |                 |                   |

# 时态(时态题核心：动作时间判断)

构成时态、语态

* do：现在，过去，虚拟

* will：将来

* have：完成

* be：进行，被动

## 8种基本时态

| 8种状态\时间 | 过去                                    | 现在                                       | 将来                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 一般         | did <br />was/were done                 | do/does <br />am/is/are done               | will do <br />will be done |
| 进行         | was/ware doing<br />was/were being done | am/is/are doing <br />am/is/are being done | will be doing              |
| 完成         | had done <br />had been done            | have/has done <br />have/has been done     | ×                          |

时态重点：3个过去时和现在完成时

## 两种特殊时态

过去将来时（在过去谈论将来，需要2个时间概念体现）：would do

完成进行时（强调过去到现在一直在发生，表示最近一直）：have been doing

## 虚拟语气

|           | 主句            | 从句     |
| --------- | --------------- | -------- |
| 过去      | would have done | had done |
| 现在/将来 | would do        | did      |

标志：if/would have done/otherwise/or/without/but for...



**需特殊处理的：wish/as if/as though+**

* 过去：had done
* 现在：did
* 将来：would do



区分：

* would：主句一定有，从句没有
* have：过去一定有，现在将来一定没有
* be动词没有was只有were
* 根据空格当前句子时间判断
* 绝对没有will



虚拟语气倒装：

* Had I= If I had
* Were I= If I were
* Should I=If I should



the minute/when/as soon as/the moment 当……时



> 祈使句：表将来（还没做过），也是主将从现
>
> Try not to wake up the baby if you go into the room.

> The painting _ to someone who later donated it to the college.  **考点：过去，被动**
>
> A. had sold  **B. was sold** C. will sell D. is sold **E. had been sold**

> You know, I _ for a job for three months, but I haven't get any luck.  **过去现在，强调动作延续**
>
> **have been looking**

> Since there **are** five managers giving reports, the meeting _ for at least two hours. **现在。开会2小时不是普遍**
>
> A. lasts 不强调，普遍
>
> B. lasted
>
> **C. will last**
>
> D. would last

> _the picture of the popular singer，I would show it to you right now．如果我拍了，我会给你
>
> A.I had taken
>
> B. Did I take
>
> **C. Had I taken** 祈使句倒装
>
> D. I took

## 表达情感

> I wonder if I might use your bike
>
> You mustn't park here!
>
> The door won't open!



## 主将从现：一般现在/现在进行时表将来

进行时：强调正在发生，生动场景感

一般现在时表将来：主将从现、固定时刻

现在进行时表将来：特殊动词（go/come/open/close,die等，[The door is closing 门快关了]





解题：看主被动关系，看时间先后



> We **intend to go** India, even if air fares _ again between now and next summer. 打算做……，主将从现
>
> A went up
>
> B. will go up
>
> C. were going up
>
> **D. go up**

> -Do you think he will send you a card?
>
> -Yes, if he **goes** on holiday. 省略了he will...，所以用主将从现



祈使句表将来也需主将从现

> Remember to do sth when you **phone** home.



## 过去完成时

时机：

* 描述过去的过去/过去2个动作分出先后顺序
* 描述过去的虚假条件

### 常见标志

by (the time) + 时间：到……为止

> eg：By the time of last year, we had built two bridges.
>
> He said he had worked in that factory since 1949.

> We had hoped to be able to come and see you, but we were too busy. **本来**希望来看你，但是太忙



## 现在进行

时机：

* 正在进行/变化

* 强调反复发生，有抱怨/责备语气

  > You are always making promises. 你总是说话不算数

| 常用的现在进行的时间副词 | 用法                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| now，nowadays            | 句首+逗号，句尾                            |
| currently, presently     | 可以放在句首，句尾，或者be currently doing |
| still                    | is still doing                             |







## 其他

just now：刚才，要用一般过去时

up to now：到现在为止（过去到现在）

ever since：自那以后（过去到现在）

### 1个附加考点

do：

* 省略to的to do(have/let/make)
* 祈使句谓语



非谓语动词是从句的省略形式

> Li is a teacher, who teaches English.
>
> Li is a teacher teaching English.

> I have the key, which is used to open the door.
>
> I have the key used to open the door.



> After completing and signing it, please return the form to us in the envelope _.
>
> A. providing
>
> **B**. provided
>
> C. having provided
>
> D. provide
>
> > 添成从句：..., ...in the envelop, which was provided.





### 非谓语动词句型

doing sth, sb do sth 同时

to do sth, sb do sth 目的

done by sth, sb do sth 被动，可描述人物感受

having done sth, sb do sth 动作先后发生

doing/being done sth do sth





### 动名词和现在分词做定语的区别

动名词做定语：表示用途和性质

现在分词做定语：与所修饰名词有诸位关系，强调动作进行性



> a sleeping boy 动作
>
> a sleeping bag 用途



### to be done, being done, done

to be done：强调将要被进行的动作

> The meeting to be held tomorrow is important.

being done：强调正在进行

> The meeting being held now is important.

done：强调被动或已经完成

> The meeting held yesterday was important.



### 独立主格结构/with的复合结构

独立主格特征：

* 逻辑主语与句子主语不同
* 逻辑主语和它后面的分词、形容词，介词短语等成分存在主谓/动宾关系

技巧：如果非谓语动作不是主语干的，谁干的把谁加上

非谓语动词有：

* 动名词，现在分词ving
* 不定式
* 过去分词



可用”with/without+名词/代词+宾补“结构替换独立主格：

> Weather permitting, we are going to visit you tomorrow.
>
> With weather permitting, ...



> The party will be held in the garden, weather _.
>
> **A**. permitting
>
> B. to permit
>
> C. permitted
>
> D. permit
>
> > 如果是if weather _，填permits，主将从现



### 分词做状语，勿偷换主语



### 能加非谓语动词做宾补的动词

接带to的动词不定式做宾补的动词有：want, ask, wish, tell, teach, encourage, warn, advise, order, force, like, allow, beg, cause, expect, invite, forbid, require, persuade+sb to do 

接不带to的动词不定式做宾补的动词有：

* 感觉，心理：see, watch, observe, notice, find, look at, hear, listen to, feel, think
* 使，让：make, get, have, leave, keep
* 命令，希望，要求：want, order, wish, like

# 语法

## 时态

时态问题五大绝招：

* 时态语态结合：先考虑语态，再考虑时态
* 主将从现：时间/条件状语从句中，主句用将来时，从句可用现在时表将来
* 出现时间点，一定用进行时
* A but B类似并列结构，时态一致
* 留心：sorry, Execuse me; A≥B，一般选A

## 主谓一致

就近原则

There is a cow and several sheep.

There are several sheep and a cow.



集体名词不一般，

army, class, team, family, couple最常见

强调个体用复数，强调整体用单数

时间距离与货币，谓语多半用单数

百分，分数做主语，名词决定谓单复



and连接两主语，单复有异灵活变

many a, more than one, 谓语动词应用单

a boy or two谓用单，one or two boys谓用复  



there be, here be, not only...but also, either...or

neither...nor 就近原则挂嘴边

with, like, except, but, together, with, as well as, 

rather than 连接两主语，谓语看前定单复（就远原则）



## was were

was 单数

were 复数。虚拟语气用were：I wish I were...



### 主动表被动，不能使用被动语态的：

不及物动词：

* open
* exist
* happen
* take place
* show

及物动词，有，含有：

* have 
* hold
* contain
* cost
* equal
* fail
* beg

感官动词，……起来：

其他：

* want, need, require (+to be done)
* worth doing
* be adj to do：不定式的逻辑宾语是句子主语，可用主动表被动

本身带有被动的短语：

* run out 用完
* give out 发布，散发
* break out
* turn out (to be) 结果是
* come out 结果是
* be to blame 应受惩罚
* be to rent 被出租
* belong to 属于



> use up：不是主动表被动，要用被动语态



固定句式：

* If only sb did sth
* It is high/about time that sb did sth. 该做……了
* would rather that sb did sth. 宁愿某人组某事
* Would you mind if I did...? 你介意我做……吗？
* It is the first time that... （从句用完成时）



现在完成-一般过去

现在完成时-过去完成时

现在完成-现在完成进行

* have done
* have been doing

一般现在时-进行时：

* do

* doing：

  * 正在进行

  * 频度副词always等+being表示感情色彩

    Why are you always being so late?

  * 强调时间点

    I will be flying to Beijing this time tomorrow.

一般将来-进行时表将来：

* will do
* be going to
* be to do：客观安排或受人指示做
* be doing



> "life is like walking in the snow", Granny used to say, "because every step _."
>
> A. has shown
>
> B. is showing
>
> **C**. shows
>
> D. showed
>
> > show没被动
> >
> > used to do：过去常常做
> >
> > 没强调进行，没有一段时间

> I _ to visit you later hat day, but I had to phone and cancel.
>
> A. come
>
> B. came
>
> C. am coming
>
> **D**. was coming
>
> > A but B，时态一致是did
> >
> > 本来打算做

> No conclusion **will be reached**（reach）about whether to tear down the old buildings for a theme park until several discussions **have been held**. 在大家进行讨论之前，是否拆除旧建筑的决定不能下结论

>
> He asked if I knew him

#### 特殊疑问句：保留特殊疑问词引导的宾语从句

#### 否定：don't → not to do

#### Please, Will/Would/Can/Could you...? → ask

>He asked **how much I paid** for the violin.

> She asked Tom **what was the matter** with his car.
>
> what可以做主语

>Do you know **what** Mr. Black's address is?

>
> > recently 跟现在完成时



**一般现在时**

She says, "I will go for a walk after dinner."

-She says she will go for a walk after dinner.



## 被动语态

### 被动语态——一般将来时的被动语态

shall/will be done

won't/shan't be done

will/shall +主语+ be done?

#### 易错点：

1. 别忘be动词

   My advice will definitely **be** taken at last. 

2. 注意否定形式not的位置

   More trees will not be destroyed in our willage.

3. 主将从现在被动中要保留

   If I'm given more time, I am sure I'll do it better.

4. 含有双宾语的主动变被动，间接宾语变成主语，直接宾语不变

   > My mom will give me a birthday present.
   >
   > me是间接宾语，a birthday present是直接宾语
   >
   > →I will be given a birthday present by my mom.

5. 不要丢介词

   We will look after the baby well.

   →The baby will be looked after well.

6. 使役动词have, get, make，感官动词see, watch, notice, hear, feel, observe等价不定式做宾补时，主动结构中省略to，变被动时要把to加上

   I will hear Mr Deng sing in the classroom tomorrow.

   →Mr Deng will be heared to sing in the classroom tomorrow.



> The wet weather will continue tomorrow, when a cold front **will be expected** to arrive.

> In near future, more advances in the robot technology **will be made by scientists.
>
> make advances in... by sb



> used to do	过去常常做
>
> be/get used to doing	习惯于做……
>
> be used to do 	被用来做……
>
> 
>
> In my opinion, life in the twenty-first century is much easier than _.
>
> A. that used to be
>
> B. it is used to
>
> C. is was used to
>
> **D. it used to be.** that是介词，后边加名词或代词，只有it可以做形式宾语



> I love to buy a new dress at a _ at the Spring Festival.
>
> **A. discount**：固定搭配at a discount
>
> B. bargain
>
> C. pay
>
> D. cost

>
> Luckily, it's **for** nothing. 省略了charge

>

>
> B. as twice
>

### 用法：

1. 描述过去动作对现在的影响

2. 强调动作开始于过去，一直持续到现在

   How long has the film been on?



### 易错点：

1. 不忘be动词
2. 含有双宾语的主动变被动，间接宾语变成主语，直接宾语不变
3. 不丢介词



> His sister left home in 1998, and _ since.
>
> A. had not been heard of
>
> **B. has not been heard of**
>
> C. had not heard of
>
> D. has not heard of
>
> 需要用被动，AB是被动。since省略了：since 1998
>
> 过去完成对现在的影响，用现在完成时。  

> In recent years, many football clubs _ as business to make a profit.
>
> A. have run
>
> **B. have been run**
>
> C. had been run
>
> D. will run
>
> In recent years：现在完成时的标志词
>
> 用过去完成时，要有动作发生在过去的过去，或者有标志词did

> Shakespeare's play Hamlet _ into at least ten different films over the past years.
>
> A. Had been made
>
> B. was made
>
> **C. has been made**
>

>
> A. have run out
>
> **B. are running out**
>
> C. have been run out
>
> D. are being run out
>
> run out 没有被动语态，本身有被动的意思，如被用光，被耗尽。排除CD，句意应该是即将被用光要马上采取行动，所以选B，进行时态表将来

> Every year a flood of farmers arrive in Shenzhen for the money-making jobs they _ before leaving their hometowns.
>
> A. promised
>
> B. were promised
>
> C. have promised
>
> **D. have been promised**
>
> 被承诺，对现在有影响，用现在完成时

## 被动语态——现在进行时的被动语态

肯定：am/is/are being done

My car is being repaired now.

否定：am/is/are not being done

My car is not being repaired now.

疑问：Am/Is/Are 主语 being done...?

Is your car being repaired now?





### 解题注意

1. 判断主被动关系
2. 选择正确时态

#### 易错点

1. 不忘be动词
2. 含有双宾语的主动变被动，间接宾语变主语，直接宾语不变
3. 不丢介词



> Traditional folk(民族) **arts** of Tianjin like paper cutting _ at the culture show of the 2010 Shanghai World Expo.

| If从句，主句（主将从现，退一步） | If从句                            | 主句                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 对现在的虚拟                     | did/were（**必须were，不能was**） | would/should/could/might do        |
| 对过去的虚拟                     | had done                          | would/should/could/might have done |
| 对将来的虚拟                     | did<br />should do<br />were do   | would/should/could/might do        |

**主过将 从过，主过将完 从过完**

* 主句过去将来时would do，从句用一般过去式
* 主句过去将来完成时would have done, 从句用过去完成时

#### 错综时间条件句

> If you had follow my advice just now, you would be better now.
>
> > 主从句都有时间标志词，分开各管各的

#### if省略句

> If I were you, I would not let her go.
>
> =Were I you, I would not let her go.

#### 含蓄条件句

句中有with, without, or, otherwise, or else等，虽然没有出现if，但表示if的含义

> Without your help, I wouldn't have passed the exam.
>
> =If you didn't help me, ...



####  but for

but for ..., sb could/should have done 要不是因为……，虚拟



### wish, as if/though, if only

退一步：

* do：did

* did：had done

* will do：would do

> I wish I were a bird.
>
> =If only I were a bird.



---

>
> If he _ me about it, I would would have done with him.

> If he had sepnt more time practicing English before. he _ able to speak it much better now.
>
> A. will be

> _ the morning train, he would not have been late for the meeting.
>
> A. Did he catch
>
> B. should be catch
>
> C. has he caught
>
> **D. Had he caught**

> The weather has been very hot and dry.
>
> Yes, If it had rained even a drop, things would be much better now! Any my vegetables _.
>
> A. wouldn't die

>
> A. have booked
>
> B. booked
>
> C. book
>
> **D. had booked**



### 情态动词+have done：推测/虚拟

|      | 句子                       | 语义                    |
| ---- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 推测 | must/can't have done       | 语气强，证据充足        |
|      | could/couldn't have done   | 语气较弱，有证据        |
|      | might/might not have done  | 语气较弱，依据不足      |
| 虚拟 | should/shouldn't have done | 本应该/不应该 责备语气  |
|      | could/couldn't have done   | 本可能/不可能 惋惜/意外 |
|      | needn't have done          | 本不需要                |



would rather not have done：宁愿当时没做（后悔当时做了）



should/ought to have done	本该做而没做（抱怨和责备）

should not/ought not to have done	本不该做而做了





**注意：**

* mustn't, can/need have done直接排除

* would have done为虚拟语气



> We _ the difficulty together, but why didn't you tell me?
>
> A. should face
>
> B. might face
>
> **C. could have faced**
>
> D. must have face
>
> 我们本来能够一起面对困难



### should类虚拟语气：以下及物动词接了宾语从句，从句应该用should do

一坚持：insist

二命令：order, command, recommend(建议)

三建议：advise, suggest, propose, 

四要求：require, request, demand, ask

**记法：I drop caps**



被动语态要用虚拟语气：It is insisted/suggested that sb should do sth.

名词形式也要用虚拟语气：It is aproposed that sb should do sth.  



翻译为……不用虚拟语气：

* insist 真实情况：主从一致；虚假：should do

* suggest 暗示，表名：主从一致； 建议：should do



> I suggest (that) you (should) get up early in the morning.



> The doctor insisted that the boy _ seriously ill and that _ on at once.
>
> A. be; be operated
>
> **B. was; be operated**
>
> C. be; was operated
>
> D. was; was operated



### 固定句型

Would you mind sb+谓语虚拟?：你是否介意……？

would rather that sb+谓语虚拟：宁愿……

It is high time that sb did/(should) do sth. 到某人做某事的时间

It is necessary/important/essential/strange/natural/advisable that sb (should) do sth.

It is a pity/duty/shame/regret that sb (should) do sth.

But for/Without + sth+主语+谓语虚拟：要不是……

If only+主语+谓语虚拟：要是……就好了

主句+as if/as though+主语+谓语虚拟：就好像



### 难点：

1. 一半过去一半现在：分开讨论

2. 一半虚拟一半真实

   I might have given you more help, **but** I was too busy.

   

   > Bob would have helped us yesterday, but he _.
   >
   > **A. was busy**
   >
   > B. is busy
   >
   > C. had been busy
   >
   > D. will be busy

   > We _ last night, but we went to the cinema instead.
   >
   > A. must have studied
   >
   > B. might study
   >
   > C. would study
   >
   > **D. would have studied**
   >
   > 从句一般过去时， 主句过去将来完成时

3. If省略，句子倒装

4. 含蓄条件句：句中不出现if，用其他手段代替。with, without..., or..., otherwise..., ... or else

   What would you do with a million dollars?

   =What would do if you had a million dollars?



​		I would not have passed this exam, without help.

​		=But for your help, I would not have passed this exam.

​		

> We lost our way in that small village, otherwise we _ more places of interest yesterday.
>
> A. visited
>
> B. had visited
>
> C. would visit
>
> **D. would have visited**
>
> If we hadn't lost our way...

> Without electronic computers, much of today's advanced technology _.
>
> A. will not have been achieved
>
> B. have not been achieved
>
> **C. would not have been achieved**
>
> D. had not been achieved
>
> without 含蓄条件句，主句要有情态动词
>
> If we hadn't have/own/used electronic...

### 解题技巧

1. 找固定句型
2. 主过将从过，主过将完从过完







## 倒装结构：闹事原则

| 除AH，都是部分倒装 |                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| N                  | never, not, hardly 等否定词 |
| **A**：形式倒装    | as                          |
| O                  | only                        |
| S                  | so, such                    |
| H：完全倒装        | here, there地点和时间副词   |
| I                  | if                          |

### N：否定副词或短语置于句首，句子部分倒装

否定副词：never, nor, hardly, little, seldom, scarcely, rarely

否定短语：

* at no time
* under/in no circumstances
* in no case
* by no means
* on no condition
* on no account
* no sooner...than
* hardly...when



> Never before have I heard of such a name.
>
> By no means shall I change the plan. 我绝不会改变这个计划

> On no account will I make it.



### A：形式倒装（前置）：只把强调的内容提到句首，主谓不倒装；as/though引导让步状语从句

> Although he likes her much, he doesn't want to be with her.
>
> -Much as he likes her, he doesn't want to be with her.

#### 表语前置

> Although he was tired, he still went on with his work.
>
> -Tired as he was, he still went on with his work.



#### 名词做表语

> Although he is a little boy, he an help his mom a lot.
>
> -Little boy as he is, he can help his mom a lot.



#### 谓语动词前置

> Although he might try hard, he didn't pass the exam.
>
> -Try hard as he might, he didn't pass the exam.



### O："only+状语"置于句首，句子部分倒装

Only in this way can we learn English well.

=We can learn English well only in this way.



#### 注意：

1. only+主语，句子不倒装

   Only you can help me.

   Only can you help me.**(×)**

2. only修饰从句时，从句不倒装，主句倒装

   Only when he returned did we find out the truth.

   Only when did he returned did we find out the truth.**(×)**



> The bus is coming here!
>
> -Here comes the bus!

only if + did +主+谓语

> Only if you put the sun there did the movements of the other planets in the sky make sense.
>
> 只有当你把太阳放在中心位置上，天空中其他行星的运动才能说得清楚。
>
> Only if you try hard, will you succeed. 



if only：但愿，要是……就好了，常引导含虚拟语气的条件句或感叹句

If only I were a bird. 



> _ you eat the correct foods _ be able to keep fit and stay healthy.
>
> **A. Only if; will you** 
>
> B. Only if; you will
>
> C. Unless; will you
>
> D. Unless; you will





### S：so/such...that 置于句首加强语气：so adj/adv，such n

So angry was he that he couldn't speak.



so+be/do/情态动词+主语，表示也……

He is a teacher. So is his mother.

You can plan tennis. So can I.



> Mike is a clever boy.
>
> So is his little brother. 他弟弟也这样。



> Mike is a clever boy.
>
> So he is. 确实如此



万能句式：It is the same with sb.



### H：地点副词或介词短语置于句首，句子完全倒装

here, there, up down, in, away, off, out, back

now, then

in the room, on the wall



#### 注意：

1. 主语是副词时不倒装

   Here you are.

2. 谓语动词必须是简单时态，如一般现在时，一般过去时

   The bus is coming here!

   =Here comes the bus.



I：if虚拟条件句的省略形式：

> If I were you, I would not let her go.
>
> →Were I you, I would not let her go.



> _ the morning train, he would not have been late for the meeting.
>
> A. Did he catch
>
> B. Shouhd he catch
>
> C. Has he caught
>
> **D**. Had he caught
>
> > 倒装+虚拟，对过去的虚拟用过去完成时





## 过去分词做宾语补足语

主+v+宾+补

When he arrived, he found all the work finished. 发现所有工作被完成了



可以接非谓语形式做宾补的动词：表示感觉，心理状态；表示使，让；表示命令，希望，要求



| 宾补形式   | 动作情况                       | 宾语与宾补的逻辑关系 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| (to) do    | 动作完成或结果                 | 主动                 |
| doing      | 正在进行或持续                 | 主动                 |
| being done | 正在进行或持续                 | 被动                 |
| done       | 动作完成、状态，或动作的全过程 | 被动                 |

> To learn English well, we should find opportunities to hear English _ as much as we can.
>
> A. speak
>
> B. speaking
>
> **C. spoken**
>
> D. to speak
>
> 多听别人说英语，应是被别人说

> Before driving into the city, you are required to get your car _.
>
> **A. washed**
>
> B. wash
>
> C. washing
>
> D. to wash

> Alexander tried to get his work _ in the medical circles.
>
> A. to recognize
>
> B. recognizing
>
> C. recognize
>
> **D. recognized**
>
> 尽力使自己的工作被医学界被认可

> Claire had her luggage _ an hour before her plane left.
>
> A. check
>
> B. checking
>
> C. to check
>
> **D. checked**



## 过去分词做状语

1. 过去分词做状语（时间，条件，原因，方式，伴随）
   1. 分清主被动关系
   2. 分清动作已经完成还是同时进行
2. 分词做状语时，保持与句子主语一致，不要偷换主语
3. 独立主格结构



**先考虑主被动，后考虑时间关系**

> Time, _ correctly, is money in the back.
>
> A. to use
>
> **B. used**
>
> C. using
>
> D. use

> _ into English, the sentense was found to have an entirely different word order.
>
> A. Translating
>
> **B. Translated**
>
> C. To translate
>
> D. Having translated

> _ not to miss the flight at 15:20, the manager set out for the airport in a hurry.
>
> A. Reminding
>
> **B. Reminded**
>
> C. To remind
>
> D. Having reminded

> _ to reach them on the phone, we sent an email instead.
>
> A. Fail
>
> B. Failed
>
> C. To fail	动词不定式，表示动作还未发生
>
> **D. Having failed** 
>
> fail to do sth/succeed in doing
>
> 主动，我们没做成 



# 主从复合句

定语从句=形容词性从句

> 本来是形容词+名词，定语从句是：名词+引导词+形容词性从句

状语从句=副词性从句

## 完整性及引导词判断

| 主从句完整性 | 引导词                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 都不完整     | 事物：what<br />who/whom<br />倒装强调事物：what<br />倒装强调状态：how |
| 从句完整     | where，when，why，how，whether/if, <br />无补充内容：that    |
| 主句完整     | 事物：that/which<br />人物：that/who/whom<br />whose<br />why<br />as 正如 |
| 都完整       | when, where<br />that 同位语解释抽象名词、连词逻辑关系       |

被动语态后面不需要名词，形式主语句型主句不完整，强调句型固定that/who



> 最高级+that+...，不是what



## 名词性从句

that从句作宾语时，that可以省略



> 注意名词性从句主语和动词顺序
>
> They are not sure who **he is**.

> 注意名词性从句主语动词单复一致
>
> **The fact** that today's... **brings** many social changes.



### that,what区分

that：陈述句，句子内容完整

what：提出问题，句子内容不完整



## 定语从句

定语：把原来的形容词和介词短语所做的定语成分换成一个句子

先行词：名词

关系词：连接主句和从句



**定语从句引导词绝对不是what**





限制性：修饰限制作用，**that只用于限制性定语从句，和逗号不共存**

* 关系代词：who whom which whose that as
* 关系副词：when where why
* 介词+关系代词：whom which

非限制性：补充说明作用

* 关系代词：who whom which whose as
* 关系副词：when where why



**解题思路：**

* 找到从句画括号：连接词起，第二个谓语动词前止

* 根据成分选连词

  > 一看指人还是物（人：who, whom, whose, that；物：that, which, whose）
  >
  > 二看介词(in, on at等）在何处
  >
  > > 介词+whom对应人
  > >
  > > 介词+which对应物
  > >
  > > 介词在从句句首：whom, which。比如in **which**
  >
  > 三看句中作何用
  >
  > 四看是否属特殊



> 介词+不定代词的用法注意：
>
> 1. whose+名词=the 名词+of which/of which+the 名词
>
>    > Have you seen the man whose eyes are blue?
>    >
>    > -Have you seen the man **the eyes of which** are blue?



> Look out! Don't get too close to the house _ roof is under repair.
>
> **A**. whose
>
> B. which
>
> C. of which
>
> D. that
>
> > 如果后边是the roof，用of which



> That evening, **which** I will tell you more about later, I ended up working very late. 
>
> 
>
> By 16:30, _ was almost closing time, nearly all the paintings had been sold.
>
> **A. which**
>
> B. when
>
> C. what
>

>
> 有逗号，不能用that，定语从句引导词绝对是what，when是副词不能作为主语

### 介词+不定代词的用法

1. 介词+whom/which

   There are 50 students in our class room, most **of whom** are boys.

   Here is Shandong, **in which** I grow up.

2. 介词的选择要结合从句的谓语动词

   Here is Shandong, **from** which I come.

3. **whose=of which**: whose+名词=the 名词+of which/of which+the 名词

   The house **whose roof/the roof of which/of which the roof** was damaged has now been repaired. 

> The man pulled out a gold watch, **the hands of which** was made of small diamonds.

> She showed the visitors around the museum, the construction _ had taken moren that three years.

> He is such a clever boy **as** everyone likes.
>
> He is such a clever boy **that** everyone likes him.
>
> > (the same) such...as... 引导定语从句，句中as要做成分
> >
> > (the same) such...that... 引导状语从句，句中that不做成分
> >
> > 去掉that/as看从句是否完整

>In our class there are 46 students, **of whom** half wear glasses.
>
>half of...

## 状语从句

| 状语从句 | 常用引导词                                        | 特殊引导词                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **时间** | when, while, as, once, till, since, until, before | not...until, as soon as, the minute/moment, the second, every time, no sooner... than, hardly...when |
| 地点     | where                                             | anywhere, everywhere, wherever                               |
| **条件** | if, as long as, unless, if only, in case          | providing/supposing that(考虑到), on condition that(如果，在……条件下) |
| 原因     | because, since, as, now that                      | seeing that, considering that, **given that(考虑到)**        |
| 目的     | so that, in case, in order that                   | lest, for fear that, in the hope that, for the purpose that  |
| 结果     | so that, so...that/such...that                    | to the degree/extent that                                    |
| 方式     | as, as if/though, how                             | the way                                                      |
| **让步** | though/although, even if, while, since            | no matter+特殊疑问词 特殊疑问词-ever                         |
| 比较     | than, as...as, not as/so...as                     | the more...the more, no...more than                          |



since 自从，现在完成时标志词





### 时间状语从句

易错点1：when, while, as

* when 从句的谓语动词通常是短暂的
* while 从句的谓语动词一定是延续的



易错点2：till, until, not...until

* 肯定句：延续性动词until/till
* 否定句：非延续性动词not...until



### 让步状语从句

易错点1：though/although可与yet, still, nevertheless同时初选，但不能与but同时出现

* though可置于句末，表示不过，但是

  > He said he would help me; he didn't, though.



易错点2：while/whereas(虽然，鉴于)引导，强调主句与从句对比

> When I like him, I still see his shortcoming.



> _ you start eating in a helthier way, weight control will become much easier.
>
> A. Unless
>
> B. Although
>
> C. Before
>
> **D**. Once



## 名词性从句

分为：

* 主语从句：左边是It做形式主语/什么都没有
* 宾语从句
* 表语从句：左边是系动词
* 同位语从句：左边是抽象名词



解题：

1. 找到从句画括号

2. 根据成分选连词

   > 主语：who（人） what（物）
   >
   > 宾语：who/whom（人）what（物）
   >
   > 定语：which
   >
   > 状语：where, when, why, how
   >
   > 不做成分，无意义：that
   >
   > 不做成分，有意义：whether/if





### 易错点

**whether or not不能换为if or not**



if和whether引导从句

* 主语从句：句首可用whether
* 宾语从句：做vt.宾语：均可，但有区别；做介词宾语whether
* 表语从句/同位语从句：whether





if和whether和that引导从句

* that：无意义，不充当句子成分，宾语从句中可省略
* if/whether：是否，不充当句子成分，不能省略

做题技巧：

* 从句中不缺成分，应用that/whether(if)
* 然后看从句中是否缺含义，缺是否：填whether/if；不缺含义：填that



that和what引导从句：what不能引导定语从句，但能引导名词性从句

* what充当主语，宾语等成分；what引导名词性从句：what=all that 
* that不做任何成分



it做形式主语和形式宾语：

* 形式主语

  * It is + n/adj/-ed that... （）

    表示建议，要求，命令，愿望，义务，责任时，从句谓语动词常用(should) do：

    > It strange that he (should) say no.

  * It is + vi that...

* 形式宾语：

  * 含有复合宾语，可用it做形式宾语，常用此句型的动词：think, find, feel, consider, make, judge等

    > We that it impossible that you can finish the job.

  * 介词后的宾语从句可以用it来代替

    > I have nothing to tell you except/that I love you.



wh-ever引导的从句：

* whatever, whichever, whoever, whomever可做主语和宾语，引导从句相当于先行词+关系代词

  > I'll just say whatever comes to my mind.
  >
  > -I'll just say anything that comes to my mind.



reason引导的名词性从句：

* reason做主语，表语从句一般用that引导

* 用it/this/that做主语时，从句可用because/why引导

  The reason why/is that...

  It/This/That is because...

  It/This/That is why...

  It/This/That is the reason why...

  This is why... is that



主语从句和强调句的区别：不是强调句就是主语从句。强调句：It is/was ... that...。区分：去掉It be...that...后仍然通顺完整为强调句，否则为主语从句



同位语从句和定语从句的区别：

| 区别       | 语义     | that                                             | when, where, why                       | how  |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| 定语从句   | 修饰限制 | 有时可省，除连接句子外，还可充当主语、并与等成分 | 意义与先行词基本相同                   | 不用 |
| 同位语从句 | 补充说明 | 只起连接作用，不充当成分，不可省略               | 意义与被同位的词无关，跟疑问词本身相同 | 可用 |



## 强调句

It is/was +被强调部分+that/who+句子剩余成分

一般疑问句：Is/Was it+被强调部分+that/who+剩余成分

特殊疑问句：疑问词+is/was+it that +剩余成分

do/does/did +v  强调谓语

> do work together in some areas 的确在一些方面共同合作



### 区别是不是强调句

1. 根据It is/was 后面的成分在句子中充当的成分来判断
2. 根据时态



一般：（疑问句：还原成陈述句）It is/was，that（或者要填的空）删掉，看句子意思完整就是强调句。



> It was from only a few supplies that she bad bought in the village _ the hostess cooked such a nice dinner.
>
> A. where
>
> **B. that**
>
> C. when
>
> D. which
>
> 只用了村子里买来的东西一点点，能做出很好的晚餐

> Was it on a lonely island _ he was saved one month after the boat went down.
>
> A. where
>
> **B. that**
>
> C. which
>
> D. what

> I've read another book this week.
>
> Well, maybe _ is not how much you read but what you raad that counts.
>
> A. this
>
> B. that
>
> C. there
>
> **D. it**
>
> counts 算数，有用
>
> 是强调句：去掉 _ is...that意思完整
>
> 不是你读了多少书就有用 

> It was _ he came backed from Africa _ he met the girl he would like to marry.
>
> A. when; then
>
> B. not; until
>
> **C. not until; that**
>
> D. only; when
>
> 改写句子：he met... not until he came backed... 成分完整，是强调句

  > Don't speak until (you) are spoken to.
  >
  > She stood there as if (she was) waiting for someone.
  >
  > Though (it is) cold, he still wore a shirt.

* 从句主语时it，谓语动词含有be，可以一并省略

  > I'll come to see you if (it is) necessary.

* so或not代指上下文的内容

  > Get up early tomorrow. If not (you don't get up early).

* 不定式的省略（to代指不定式内容，跟在动词后，否定用not to）

  > Will you join in the game?
  >
  > I'd be glad to (go).



>We all know that, _, the situation will get worse.
>
>A. not if dealt carefully with.
>
>**B. if not carefully dealt with**
>
>C. if dealt not carefully with
>
>D. not if carefully dealt with
>
>dealt：deal过去分词

* to have been done

注意：

* 非谓语动词否定：直接前面加not
* 动名词是单数名词
* 不定式to do一般不做主语/介词宾语

非谓语在

* 句中作名词只考虑：doing/being done
* 名词前作形容词只考虑：doing/done



> _(do) is healthy.
>

> 都只能填doing



be said/reported/thought to

* 未完成：do/be done
* 已完成：have done/have been 

 

## 动作后的宾语：动作是目的用to do，不是目的用doing（95%有效）

> eg:
>
> want to play：玩是目的，用to do
>
> suggest finding ways to ...：发现途径去...，find不是目的，用doing



## 介词后跟动名词

to/by/in等

> There are a number of reasons that people who are used to **working** alone have a difficult time working on a team.  不是work
>
> be used to doing sth 习惯于做某事
>
> have difficulty (in) doing sth



## 动名词做主语时，动词要单数



## doing和done

|       | 常规         | 描述情绪感受（就是物用ing人用ed） |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| doing | 主动，进行中 | 事物/人物特点                     |
| done  | 被动，已完成 | 人物心理                          |



## 形容词从句与分词的转换规则

### 出现be动词的形容词从句，省略引导词和be动词

> The girl who is sitting here is my friend.
>
> The girl sitting here is my friend.

### 常规动词的定语从句，省略引导词，动词变成doing

> Anyone who hopes to be a pilot must...
>
> Anyone hoping to be a pilot must...



> The number of women who **go** to school in that country **has** increased by 10 percent.
>
> 不止一个人去学校：复数，数字增长：单数



## 副词从句：主句与从句主语相同时，分词的转换规则

### 出现be动词的副词从句，省略从句主语和be动词。描述同时的时间副词从句，引导词可以一并省略

> When people are stressed, they exhibit high blood pressure and accelerated heart rates.
>
> When stressed, people exhibit...
>
> Stressed, people exhibit...

### 常规动词的副词从句，省略主语，动词变成doing。描述同时的时间副词从句，引导词可以一并省略

> When people sleep with pressure, they dream four to six times each night.
>
> When sleeping with pressure, people dream...
>
> Sleeping with pressure, people dream...

> If you don't try your best, you will not...
>
> If not trying your best, you will not...
>
> you will not... if not trying your best.



### 描述原因的副词从句，省略引导词because/since，省略主语，动词变成doing

> Because the students had read the instruction, they were able to carry out the experiment alone.
>
> Having read the instruction, the students were...



# 做题

## 七选五解题步骤

1. 浏览全文，理清文章结构和主旨，30s
2. 三个关
   * 关联词
     * 总分，分总关系
     * 并列，转折，递进等逻辑关系
     * 解释说明关系
   * 关键词
   * 无关词
3. 带入选项，核对答案



## 短文改错

**要点/易错点：**

* 单复数

  没有复数的单词：

  * advice
  * information
  * housework
  * equipment

* a/an，the

  元音发音用an

  第一次提到用a/an，再次提到用the

* ing/ed

  **被动ed，主动ing**

* 形容词/副词

  形容词修饰名词，副词修饰动词

  **副词可以做句子开头**，比如：Luckily等

* 短语：do/doing sth

* 时态

  根据上下文确定时态

  特殊用法，比如I -ed, -ing sth.句型

* it/what等指代

  find it easy... 

* 上下文理解

* 固定用法：

  * only to
  * feel relaxed
  * spend time doing



## 阅读理解

阅读理解潜规则：

* 顺序对应原则：题目顺序一般就是答案在文中的顺序
* 同义替换
* 关键词原则



**文章重点：**

* 段首段尾
* **but等转折后是重点**（while/though等引导的逗号之前的不是重点）
* 比较级和最高级：划圈



方法：

1. **先读题目，后看文章**
2. 只关注有用信息，不要让无效信息浪费时间
3. 注意隐含义，勿纠结字面意思。可借助近义词/反义词
4. 切勿凭感觉做题



### 关键点

重选项，轻文章：

* 查陌生单词对解题没任何帮助，换个文章，工作全白费
* 主旨最重要，问主旨/目的/希望，不应该是赚钱/打广告（比如promote a product），高度不够
* 文章结构一般都是总-分-总，中间的段落一般是论点/例子，能少读就少读



| 解决问题                                | 需要     |                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 从文章中学到什么/文章标题               | 文章主旨 | 第一（和二）/末段，**中间的段落都是次要信息** |
| 细节题/某段重点/某句重点                | 段落主旨 | but等转折词后是重点，看语境正负态度           |
| 划线单词意思/段落大意等题（最难的问题） |          | 看上下文意思，语境，正负态度                  |





对问题和选项：

* 搞懂选项的意思，尤其是单个词的选项，确定正负态度，为得出正确选项提供依据
* 主旨题，一定和文章主旨强相关，可先排除完全无关选项





### 拆解长难句

1. 找连词，标三角（并列，转折，因果，递进等逻辑关系）
2. 找从句，划括号（从连词开始，到第二个谓语动词之前。保证从句里最多只有一个谓语动词）
   * 下一谓语动词结束
   * 到句尾结束
   * 到句中逗号结束
   * 到另一从句或修饰成分出现结束
3. 找介词短语，非谓语，划横线（介词+名词/代词，不定式，动名词，分词）
4. 留主干，译中文，调语句，拼回来



### 培养阅读习惯

* Mark：做标记。标记有效信息
* Miss：略读无效信息
  * 专有名词（人，地，物）后面的解释说明
  * 论证或说明的具体步骤
  * 照抄原文还抄错段落的选项略读→细节题不跨段落，除非有是极端
* Match：同义替换
  * 原文压根没提过的不选
  * 原文有但定位错误的不选
  * 细节题跨段落的不选
  * 主旨题扩大或缩小的不选
  * 逻辑混乱的不选：因果、时间、程度、包含



### 细节题

简单细节题和标志词：

* 事实细节：what, when, where, who, which, why, how
* 因果细节：for, as, why, because, since; due to, lead to, result from, owing to, cause...
* 目的细节：purpose, to, aim to, in order to, so as to...

复杂细节题：

* 作者/段落/具体细节观点
* 某个例子证明了什么观点



### 推断题

标志词：suggest, infer, imply, intend, conclude, means, indicate...

角度：

* 问出处，身份，对象
* 问目的
* 问隐含义
  * 复述原文的不选
  * 主观臆断的不选
  * 因果倒置的不选

解题方法：

1. 识别推断

2. 准确定位

3. 正向/逆向推理

   正向：看情感，标正负

   逆向：对比转折，弦外之音

4.  锁定答案



### 词义猜测

根据上下文合理推断



### 主旨题

选择文章标题/作者的目的或写作意图



解题方法：

* 通篇略读，把握大意
* 找主旨句：首（一般是首段最后一句/第二段第一句），末，中
  * 圈关键词
  * 忽略细节：for example, to begin with, first类似举例，列举不可能出现主旨句
* 选择标题或概括主旨，避免：以偏概全，主题扩大，断章取义，无中生有





## 语法填空

**一般原则：**

* 不抄原词：概率太低
* 不要由繁到简：比如truthful→truth
* 要按要求



考点：

* 有提示词：
  * 动词：时态语态，非谓语，词形变换
  * 名词代词：单复数，人称变化，反身代词
  * 形容词副词：词形变换，比较级最高级
* 无提示词：
  * 连词关系词：主从句，逻辑关系
  * 介词
  * 冠词
  * 特殊选择：and/or/but



动词是句子的核心，句子中必须有谓语，不一定非谓语。

谓语：体现时态变化和主被动形态变化

非谓语：补充句意，不同形态含义不同



### 有提示词

| 谓语动词时态  | 主动            | 被动                 |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| 过去之前      | had done        | had been done        |
| 过去          | did             | was/were done        |
| 过去正在/一直 | was/were doing  | was/were being done  |
| 过去和现在    | have/has done   | have/has been done   |
| 无时间要求    | do/does         | am/is/are done       |
| 现在正在      | am/is/are doing | am/is/are being done |
| 将来          | will do         | will be done         |
| 将来正在/一直 | will be doing   | will be being done   |

（过去/现在/将来正在的被动不是重点）



| 非谓语动词主动 | 含义                                           | 被动       | 含义                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| doing          | 与谓语动词同时发生、介词后做名词、描述事物性质 | done       | 与谓语动作同时/先后发生、描述人物心理 |
| to do          | 动作未发生，表示目的                           | to be done | 动作未发生，表示目的                  |
| having done    | 与谓语动作先后发生                             | being done | 动作正在发生、介词后做名词            |



### 无提示词：空格只填1个词

如果空格后是

* 句子：关系词和连词
* 动词短语：
  * 冠词：a/an/the
  * 介词：介词短语积累，与on/in/at/with/about/for/by/of/over/under/to等的固定搭配 
  * and/or/but
* 名词短语：
  * 从句关系词：主从句划分和完整性判断

  * 连词

  * and/or/but


句子和短语的根本句别：是否有谓语/时态（被动肯定是句子）





关系词：what which who where how whether why when

连词：因果，转折，并列，条件



解法：

| 主句完整？ | 从句完整？ | 用词                                            |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ×          | ×          | what 物<br />who 人                             |
| ×          | √          | when where why how whether <br />that：不缺意思 |
| √          | ×          | that/which 物<br />that/who 人<br />whose 谁的  |
| √          | √          | when 时间<br />where 非时间<br />（why, that)   |

主句完整，从句不完整，**注意：**

* 逗号后不能用that，用who/which
* 介词后不能用that，用whom/which
* 不定代词后只用that，如something that, all that
* 最高级/极端概念后只用that，如best/first/-est that



> _ culture is rich in...
>
> 从句不完整：**缺少限定词，要用whose**




## 完形填空

考察：

* 词汇：词义，辨析，搭配
* 上下文：
  * 瞻前顾后：通览全文，重视首尾句，预测主题
  * 左顾右盼：逻辑，上下文
  * 顾全大局：符合答案，全面检查
  * 义无反顾：除非逻辑和小词辨析错误，尽量不大面积修改
* 短语和搭配：动词，名词和代词是重点；形容词，副词，介词，连词相对较少。

**做题要点：**

* 100%拿下第一句：找主线，拆首句
* 不把时间花在“扫描”上，而是“锁定”答案上
* 随时能返回来做题：往往空后线索占大部分

**关键：不要瞎蒙，证据不足就是蒙**



复习建议：

* 找主线，拆首句
* 搜集阅读材料：励志/温情，先抑后扬的故事
* 突破高频词汇、短语和搭配，词义辨析，形容词副词，介词连词to/at/in/on/above等



选项的秘密：

* 动词：根据前后搭配
* 名词：找同类
* adj/adv：感情色彩：正/负/中性
* 介词连词：根据逻辑关系。to/at/in/on/above

      -Being a student, I should study hard and try my best to become a useful person for our country.

   3. 肯定不如否定好

      Everyone is affecting others more or less, and at the same time affected by others.

      -There is hardly a man or a woman who is not affecting or affected by others.

   4. 主动不如被动好

      Nowadays, we can also use cell-phones as cameras  and laptops.
